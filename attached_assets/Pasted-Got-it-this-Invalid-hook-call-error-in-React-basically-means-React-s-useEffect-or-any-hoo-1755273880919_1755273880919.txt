Got it — this **"Invalid hook call"** error in React basically means React’s `useEffect` (or any hook) is being used in a place where React doesn’t expect it.

---

## **Flow of What’s Happening**

1. React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, etc.) **must** be called:

   * Inside the **body** of a React **function component**
   * Or inside a **custom hook** (which itself is called from a function component)
2. Your error says:

   ```
   Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useEffect')
   ```

   → This often happens when **React is not properly initialized** because:

   * There are **two copies of React** in your app
   * Mismatched versions of `react` and `react-dom`
   * Importing hooks from the **wrong React instance** (like from a dependency that bundles its own React)
   * Calling hooks **outside** a component function

## **Possible Causes**

### 1️⃣ **Two React versions installed**

Run:

```bash
npm ls react
```

If you see multiple versions → you need to ensure only **one** version is in `node_modules`.

**Fix:**

```bash
npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
```

and remove `node_modules` + reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### 2️⃣ **Mismatch between `react` and `react-dom`**

Check `package.json` — both should have **the same major version**:

```json
"react": "18.2.0",
"react-dom": "18.2.0"
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Hook used outside a function component**

❌ Wrong:

```js
useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Hello");
}, []);
```

(You can’t put this at the top level of a file.)

✅ Correct:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Hello");
  }, []);
  return <div>Hi</div>;
}
```

### 4️⃣ **ThemeProvider issue**

The stack trace says:

```
at ThemeProvider (ThemeProvider.tsx:8:3)
```

If your `ThemeProvider` is a **class component** or a normal function that’s not a React component, you **can’t** use hooks there.
It must be:

```tsx
function ThemeProvider({ children }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Theme loaded");
  }, []);
  return <ThemeContext.Provider>{children}</ThemeContext.Provider>;
}
```

---

💡 **Intuition:**
Hooks work because React keeps a special “state list” tied to the currently rendering component.
If you call them **outside** a render cycle (or in a different React instance), React can’t find that list → you get this error.

If you want, I can debug your `ThemeProvider.tsx` line-by-line and tell you exactly why `useEffect` is failing.
Do you want me to do that?
